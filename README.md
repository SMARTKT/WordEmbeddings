## Instructions

To download the embeddings :
1. Go to the mega.nz link above and download all of the files in the folder.
2. Place the embeddingClass.py file of the repo in the same path where you downloaded the embedding files.

To use the word embeddings in your own code, do the following : 
1. Import embeddingModel and EpochSaver from embeddingClass.py to your own script.
2. Create an instance of embeddingModel class and load the required embeddings (there are two function : load_ELMO_model() and load_CBOW_model()).
3. Use the functions of the embeddingModel class for required word embeddings.
